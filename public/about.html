<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Prem Ranjan, and I am a 21-year-old B.Tech student currently pursuing Artificial Intelligence and 
  Machine Learning (AIML) at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. My academic journey has been fueled by a passion for
  cutting-edge technologies and a deep curiosity about the limitless possibilities AI and ML offer in transforming industries 
  and solving real-world challenges.</p>

<p>As a tech enthusiast, I thrive on exploring innovative projects and learning new tools and techniques that sharpen my skills.
   My interests extend beyond academics into hands-on problem-solving, and I am particularly drawn to projects that combine technology 
   with societal impact. For example, I am passionate about leveraging AI and blockchain to improve efficiency and sustainability in areas
   like food grain storage and supply chain management.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not immersed in coding or research, I enjoy staying updated with the latest tech trends and connecting with like-minded peers. 
   My goal is to create meaningful solutions that leave a positive impact, and I am excited to continue growing as an aspiring AIML professional.
